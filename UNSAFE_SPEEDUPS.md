# Unsafe Speedups

These are speedups that can provide extra speed increases, but may cause weird bugs or break GGST. These speedups have generally been tested, but may not work for everyone.

Use at your own risk.

## `-unsafe-async-stats-set`

(v1.1.0+)

Totsugeki responds to GGST instantly to any `/api/statistics/set` calls with a mocked success response. Totsugeki will forward this to the GGST servers in the background so GGST doesn't have to wait.

These calls are used for updating your R-Code.

### Speedup

10-20% speedup in the title screen compared to normal Totsugeki. R-Code updates should become instant which should speed things up in various places. You'll see a larger benefit if your upload speed is slow.

### Known/Possible issues

Since this mocks a response back to GGST, the response isn't perfect. It's unknown what parts of the response are actually used by GGST, but most seems pretty static or unused. See `HandleStatsSet()` in `proxy.go`.
It's unknown if other API's expect `/api/statistics/set` to be complete before they get called. In testing GGST didn't behave any differently, but it's still unknown if there are any other side-effects.

Can cause your R-Code updates to be lost/corrupt if you close Totsugeki before it finishes uploading your R-Code.

## `-unsafe-predict-stats-get`

(v1.2.0+)

Totsugeki pre-fetches all `/api/statistics/get` calls on the title screen in parallel.

These calls are used for fetching your R-Code.

### Speedup

10-20% speedup in the title screen compared to normal Totsugeki. R-Code fetches should become instant in the title screen. Only affects load time on the title screen.

### Known/Possible issues

Since Totsugeki makes all the requests in parallel, there's a chance that the ASW servers will rate limiting you, but this was not observed in testing.
Since the requests are generated by Totsugeki the requests may not be a perfect as not all parts of the request are fully understood. This may cause weird issues and may completely break in future updates of GGST, but worked fine in testing.
